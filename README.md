# Unified Vision-Based Dynamic Planning and Object Retrieval
The robotic system begins its task by assuming an initial position, marked as the home point, to commence the search for a specific object. The objective is to pick up the identified object and transport it to a predetermined destination. The robot is equipped with wheel encoders and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) as proprioceptive sensors, allowing it to monitor its position and orientation. These sensors provide crucial data, including wheel velocity and angular position, which form the basis for the robot's movement.

To navigate through the construction environment efficiently while avoiding collisions with non-target obstacles, the system employs a combination of Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) and A* search algorithms. Both are sampling and search-based algorithms that facilitate path planning. The algorithms contribute to safe and effective navigation by generating feasible paths for the robot, ensuring it reaches the destination without encountering obstacles.

For environmental perception, the robot is equipped with an exteroceptive sensor in the form of a camera mounted on its front. This camera captures obstacle information in pixel coordinates within the robot's base frame. To enhance the quality of data for path planning, a homography method is utilized to align the pixel coordinates with the robot's frame, effectively mapping the obstacles in the environment. The removal of background using the HSV colour method ensures a clear view of the target.

To precisely identify the target object, corner detection techniques are employed while the camera frame is in motion. This allows the system to lock onto the target and maintain focus during movement. The amalgamation of these sensor outputs and algorithms collaboratively directs the robot towards its target, facilitating the successful pickup of the object, and subsequently guides it to the predetermined destination. The integration of proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors, along with advanced algorithms, ensures a robust and efficient robotic system in navigating complex construction environments while avoiding obstacles and completing tasks with precision.
